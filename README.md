# error-mitigated-quantum-models

This repository houses the codes used for error mitigation of quantum model of the perturbed coin process under /Codes. 

The data used for our findings can be found under /Data. There exists the ideal measurement outcomes, noisy measurement outcomes, and raw QEM measurement outcomes that have yet to be post-processed. All data is saved in .txt format.
