# error-mitigated-quantum-models

This repository houses the codes used for error mitigation of quantum model of the perturbed coin process under /Codes. 

The data generated can be found under /Data. The data is saved in .npz format. To read it, follow these steps:
```
load_data = np.load('file_name.npz')
data = load_data['arr_0']
```
